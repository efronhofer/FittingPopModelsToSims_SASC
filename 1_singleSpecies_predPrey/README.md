# SASC: simulating animals in continuous time

This is an agent-based model that solves an LV consumer-resource model with different resource growth models logistic, Beverton-Holt, with and without Allee effect) and type I or II functional responses for the consumer. Instead of using the slower Gillespie algorithm we use the Allen algorithm (Allen & Dytham, BioSystems 98 (2009) 37-42).
